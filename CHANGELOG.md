# Changelog

## 2025-08-03 - More Animations

### Changed
- **Notification System Refactor**: Simplified the tournament notification architecture by removing complex TypeScript generics and intermediate event objects. Each notification type now exports a single detector function that returns JSX directly, making the system easier to understand and extend.

### Added
- **Flexible Notification Routing**: Notifications can now be easily mixed and matched across different routes (e.g., `AllNotifications`, `CriticalNotifications`) for different OBS browser sources.

### Improved
- **Developer Experience**: Adding new notification types is now straightforward - just create three simple functions (detect, render, combine) without worrying about generic type constraints.
- **Queue System**: Multiple notifications from the same game update are automatically queued and displayed sequentially.

## 2025-08-03 - High Score Animations!

### Added
- **High Score Animation Overlay**: Real-time celebration popup that triggers when division high scores are broken
- **Animation Route Architecture**: New `/users/:userId/animation/*` routes with transparent backgrounds for overlay effects
- **Responsive Animation Design**: Clean, professional celebration popup that scales to any browser source size
- **Smart High Score Detection**: Compares highest score in game changes vs previous division record to prevent false triggers

### Enhanced
- **App Background Logic**: Conditional backgrounds based on route type (animations=transparent, overlays=white, pages=tan)
- **Navigation Hiding**: Animation routes properly hide navigation bar for clean overlay experience
- **Incremental Update Data Flow**: Fixed mutable state bug by cloning previous tournament data before applying changes

### Technical Details
- Animation overlay listens for `TOURNAMENT_DATA_INCREMENTAL` messages
- Only triggers when changes contain scores higher than previous division record
- Handles round completion scenarios (multiple new games) by finding highest among changes
- 5-second display duration with smooth fade transitions
- Designed for 300x200px commentator cam overlay use case

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Mutable State Issue**: Worker now properly clones previous tournament data before applying incremental changes
- **Corrected High Score Logic**: Compares changes vs true previous state instead of mutated current state
- **Resolved Background Conflicts**: Animation overlays get transparent backgrounds while regular overlays stay white

### Performance
- Zero additional API calls - leverages existing incremental update system
- Efficient change detection using PostgreSQL diff engine
- Real-time updates without impacting tournament overlay performance

## 2025-08-03

### Added
- **Incremental Tournament Updates**: Implemented true incremental game updates using worker-coordinated caching system
- **Tournament Cache Manager**: Added sophisticated cache management with incremental change application
- **Rich Broadcast Messages**: Enhanced broadcast system with full tournament data, previous state, and change metadata for overlay animations

### Changed
- **Eliminated "Thundering Herd"**: Multiple overlays now share single API call through worker coordination
- **Real-time Game Updates**: File changes now trigger incremental updates instead of full tournament refreshes
- **Network Efficiency**: Server sends only game changes over WebSocket, worker provides full data to overlays via local broadcast

### Technical Details
- Worker applies incremental changes to cache and broadcasts complete tournament data locally
- Overlays receive both old and new tournament state plus specific changes for rich animations
- PostgreSQL-based change detection using `ON CONFLICT` with `RETURNING` for atomic updates
- Division-aware filtering to update only affected overlays
- Fallback to full refresh if incremental updates fail

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced API calls from N (per overlay) to 1 (per tournament change)
- Instant cache responses for subsequent overlay loads
- Sub-second tournament update propagation
- Minimal network traffic for game changes

## 2025-08-02 Separated Tournament Data for Cleaner Debugging

### Added
- New `tournament_data` table containing `data_url`, `data`, and `poll_until` fields
- Enhanced WorkerPage debugging interface with extended mode (`?extended`)
  - WebSocket message monitoring with ping filtering
  - Broadcast message tracking
  - Message statistics and cache details
  - Real-time status updates via broadcast channels
- Separate `worker-status` broadcast channel for debugging data
- Database migration to move large data fields out of tournaments table

### Changed
- `TournamentRow` objects now exclude massive JSON data for readable console logs
- Repository methods join with `tournament_data` table to include `data_url` and `poll_until`
- Polling service updated to work with separated table structure
- WorkerSocketManager broadcasts `AdminPanelUpdate` messages to overlays
- Eliminated direct method calls between WorkerPage and worker (now uses broadcasts)
- Status updates now broadcast every second instead of manual polling

### Fixed
- Admin panel division changes now properly update overlays
- Tournament data polling comparison issues with JSONB vs JSON
- Overlay real-time updates for division switching
- Cache manager properly isolated from WebSocket manager

### Technical
- Moved from `tournamentCache.get()` direct calls to broadcast-only communication
- Repository refactored into clean helper methods for better maintainability
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout data flow
- Improved type safety by removing `any` usage in cache operations

## 2025-08-02

### Added
- **Worker-Coordinated Data Fetching**: Overlays now subscribe to tournament data through worker instead of direct API calls
- **Tournament Data Caching**: Worker maintains in-memory cache of tournament data with automatic invalidation
- **SUBSCRIBE Message Protocol**: New message type for overlay-worker data subscription coordination
- **Cache Performance Logging**: Detailed logs for cache hits/misses and fetch operations

### Changed
- **useTournamentData Hook**: Replaced direct API calls with SUBSCRIBE message broadcasting
- **WorkerSocketManager**: Enhanced to handle SUBSCRIBE messages and manage tournament data cache
- **Data Loading Flow**: Multiple overlays requesting same tournament now trigger single API call

### Performance
- **Eliminated Thundering Herd**: Multiple overlay startup now results in 1 API call instead of N calls
- **Instant Cache Responses**: Subsequent overlays get immediate data from worker cache
- **Reduced Server Load**: Significant reduction in duplicate tournament data requests

### Technical
- Cache key format: `userId:tournamentId:divisionId` for precise data targeting
- Automatic cache updates on WebSocket events (GamesAdded, AdminPanelUpdate)
- Backward-compatible message broadcasting maintains existing overlay functionality
