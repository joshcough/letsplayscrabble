   a few thoughts:             
                               
   i changed the theme for     
   the tournament to the       
   scrabble theme, and         
   nothing changed so im not   
   sure youre using the theme  
   correctly.                  
                               
   there are several black     
   boxes, but in the original  
   they are white boxes with   
   black text. but ideally     
   we would use the theme for  
   those colors.               
                               
   the tiles that appear that  
   the bottom, you have a      
   box for each tile, but the  
   players whole rack comes    
   from a camera so it should  
   just be a single            
   rectangular box per         
   player.                     
                               
   we need to get their score  
   underneath the player box   
   instead of under the game board.

   the whole thing is too wide, its not fitting on my screen, so its cutting off

   you have two black boxes above the tiles, presumably for the players timer. those should be under the players as well instead of under the game board.
