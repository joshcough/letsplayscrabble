## Analysis Summary

### Current Theme System
- **Location**: `frontend/src/config/themes.ts` - 4 themes (modern, scrabble, july4, original)
- **Types**: `frontend/src/types/theme.ts` - ThemeColors interface with comprehensive styling
- **Hook**: `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` - fetches user theme from backend
- **Settings**: `frontend/src/pages/UserSettingsPage.tsx` - theme selection UI
- **Backend**: User settings API exists with theme field

### Current Limitations
- Theme system only applies to overlay pages (detected via URL path)
- Main site uses hardcoded background: `bg-[#E4C6A0]` in App.tsx:70
- Non-overlay pages don't use theme system at all

### Tournament Schema
- Current Tournament interface (shared/types/domain.ts:118) has no theme field
- Need to add optional theme field to Tournament interface
- Need database migration to add theme column

### Infrastructure Ready
- Websocket system exists
- User theme system established
- API patterns already in place

## Task Details

### Goal
Extend the current theme system from just overlays to the entire site, and add per-tournament theme support with real-time updates via websockets.

### Key Requirements
1. Make the entire site themeable (not just overlays) âœ… NEXT
2. Add theme selection during tournament creation
3. Allow theme editing for existing tournaments  
4. Send websocket messages when tournament themes change
5. Broadcast theme changes to all overlays in real-time
