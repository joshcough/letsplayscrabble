## TODO

* New way to process a tournament:

Read the file
Add all the players to the players table (if they don't already exist)
Add all the games to the games table
Change all the code to stop reading the whole json file, but fetch the games from the tables
Review _all_ endpoints because most of them use that style and so they will have to be fixed
All the websocket code will have to be fixed to.

* Review the websocket code to figure out how to make sure all pages update automatically.
